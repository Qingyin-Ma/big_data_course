## Big Data Analysis and Applications

#### Qingyin Ma

Welcome to the public repository for the Python code of the PhD course *Big Data Analysis and Applications*. This repository serves as a central place to share example programs, teaching materials, and demonstration scripts used throughout the course.

The course is offered annually, and its content evolves over time to incorporate new methods, tools, and applications in data science, economics, and computational analysis. As a result, the materials in this repository may vary from year to year. I will continue updating the repository and, when possible, gradually integrate and organize past and future content into a more unified structure.

Many of the programs are based on integrated and extended materials from various online resources—for example, we draw extensively from [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/), with appropriate references included in the code.

Feel free to explore the code, use it for learning or research, and adapt it to your own needs. Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
